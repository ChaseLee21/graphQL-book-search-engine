  ## Description
  This project was done during the coding bootcamp I went through at the University of Oregon. This project had starter code given to me and my task was to replace the RESTful api in the starter code with GraphQL and apollo server. I had to update both the backend and the frontend to utilize GraphQL and Apollo Server. The application has a login and register system in place. It allows the user to search for books powered by Google book search api. The user can then save books for easy reference later on. Users can then delete books out of their saved books.
